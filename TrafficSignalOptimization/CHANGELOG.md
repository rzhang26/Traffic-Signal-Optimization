## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Initial release of Traffic Signal Optimization System
- Data ingestion module with NYS OData API integration
- SQLite database for local data storage
- Data validation and cleaning pipeline
- Signal timing inference from traffic patterns
- Discrete-event traffic simulation engine
- Genetic algorithm optimization with multi-objective fitness
- Full-featured GUI using Tkinter
- Command-line interface for batch processing
- Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage

### Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetch and store traffic data from NYS Traffic Data Viewer
- **Signal Timing Inference**: Automatic timing calculation based on traffic volumes
- **Traffic Simulation**: Queue theory-based simulation with Webster's formula
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Population-based optimization with elitism
- **Performance Metrics**: Throughput, delay, stops, queue length, LOS
- **GUI**: Interactive desktop application with real-time progress
- **CLI**: Scriptable command-line interface
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
